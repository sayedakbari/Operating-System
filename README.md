# Operating-System
Windows Operating system is a famous operating system that a vast majority of people use around the world. Windows Operating Systems use graphic interface, and it is compatible with different devices. It closed source program and to obtain it, you must purchase it either online or from the stores. 
Mac OS Operating System is proprietary, which means that it works only with Apple devices. Mac OS is a very stable operating system because it is more secure than the other operating systems. However, it is very expensive and many people can not afford to use Apple devices and Mac OS. Additionally, there are limited options for people who use Mac OS. For example, there are not many gaming software for Mac users; therefore, many gamers prefer Windows over Mac OS. 
Linux Operating System is an open source software, which means people can modify and change it based on their needs. Linux works on a variety of PCs, servers, and devices. Linux is vastly used in servers in large companies. For instance, two or three sites that I have worked as a security officer were using Linux for security systems. All the access doors that were equipped with the badging system were running the Linux Operating System.
